Gonna try the SimCity tutorial from CoffeeCodeCreate!

I have followed the setup from my previous ThreeJS tutorial as far as npm stuff goes.

```
npm install --save three
npm install --save-dev vite
npx vite
```

Also I made a repo on GitHub for this. Huzzah.

Learned about the camera's "up" setting. The default up vector is the y axis, I guess. I set it to be z by default because I like z to be up.
